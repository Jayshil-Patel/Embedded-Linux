when sender wants to send msg to reciever, the kernel
will provide memory (its own memory) and memory will be attached
to sender

here the message wont be cleared after reading unlike message queue, FIFO

here multiple process can write the same shared memory at same time and reading
process can read it

but problem of context switching will take place.
