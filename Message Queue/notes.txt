in case of FIFO we cannot send two messages to two 
different processes at same time

to have multiple messages we will use message queue

we will use api to send and recieve and we will
also use Structures of c 

"msgget" and "msgsend" are the two api to get and
recieve the data 

the ids are like python dictionaries they have key and values
