in pipes we have created only one program
in case of named pipe we will have 2 different program

here parent will make fork and also make sender.c
and child will make reciever.c

sender.c will create a named pipe or FIFO and sender will
put data in pipe, and if reciever have same namefile data then
and then only it will recieve data

FIFO can be created using mkfifo

this file will be created in out hard disk

FIFO is used for unrelated process and unrelated process
