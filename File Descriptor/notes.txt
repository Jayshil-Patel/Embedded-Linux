Return value of printf("number") is number of 
characters to be printed in this case 6

In case of scanf it returns number of character it 
scanned

printf is part of stdio.h this is 
stored in our Hard disk

FD table stores indexes , FD[0], FD[1] etc locations
FD[0] is index for all input files

first compiler moves to stdio.h to scan for printf
then moves to FD table and then sees FD[0] and this 
gives location in our Hard disk which stores defination 
for printf

FD[1] is always coonsidered for output
and FD[1] indexes to all output files in Hard disk
 
whatever file we make its number gets updated in FD

when we open f=fopen("test.txt","w") if this is not present 
in HDD it gets created and we get a value passed in
f containing random values, its nothing but FD index 
in FD

randomly genetated contains anything except0, 1, 2 

if file is not created successfully it will pass 
-1 in f which FD index for error files
and generates system generated message

the function "close(1)" will restrict entry of 1
close(1) will block all output 

if we put close(0) it will not take input and then 
display garbage value, but importantly FD will
be equal to 0, since 0 id free to be used.

if we put close(2), we will not get any error messages
and open:success will not be displayed
and then fd=2 since it was available to be used

if we use close(3), it will show bad file discriptor
the system warns us that the file we are creating is the 
same to be closed.
